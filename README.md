Gem with a set of useful tools used when developing Ruby based applications.

## Installation

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'polishgeeks-dev-tools'
end
```

## Setup

There are multiple options you can set either to true or false. All of them are available with configurator. Please use it only for development and testing environments. This config should be put in config/initializers/polishgeeks_dev_tools.rb file.

Note that all the options are turned on by default it depends on an app, which of the you should use.

If you want to use DevTools with all the default settings, you don't need to create an initializer.

### Rack apps (Sinatra)
```ruby
if %i( test development ).include?(App.environment)
  PolishGeeks::DevTools.setup do |config|
    # For example - lowering a simplecov_threshold
    config.simplecov_threshold = 98
  end
end
```
### Rack apps (Rails)
```ruby
if %w( test development ).include?(Rails.env)
  PolishGeeks::DevTools.setup do |config|
    config.brakeman = true # Rails only
    # You can disable any command that is executed by setting it to false
    config.rubycritic = false
  end
end

## Usage in any Rails/Ruby application

Once you've set up all the options and a config initializer, please execute following command:

```bash
bundle exec rake polishgeeks:dev-tools:check
```

## Usage with other Ruby gems

If you want to use this gem to check other gems quality, you will have to put following things in your gem Rakefile:

```ruby
require 'bundler'
require 'rake'
require 'polishgeeks-dev-tools'

desc 'Self check using command maintained in this gem'
task :check do
  PolishGeeks::DevTools.setup do |config|
    # Any config option you want to disable/enable
    config.brakeman = false
  end

  PolishGeeks::DevTools::Runner.new.execute(
    PolishGeeks::DevTools::Logger.new
  )
end

task default: :check
```

And then from command line, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake
```
